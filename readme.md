## Preparation Needed
# For Conda Environment
To install cvxpy properly (install some of the solvers needed), it is needed to install cmake both via 'conda install cmake' and 'pip install cmake'.

Always prefer install packages like numpy, scipy, etc. using 'conda install', since it better manages dependencies.

On MacOS, need to install GMP via homwbrew by 'brew install gmp'.
Then restart the terminal and install pytope again.
